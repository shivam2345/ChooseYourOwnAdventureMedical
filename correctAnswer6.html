    Sarah told you, "A stroke is something that hurts a person's brain.
		If you see someone suddenly stop feeling their arm, or start slurring their speech they may have a stroke. You can also check
		if their face is drooping on one side, or the person is suddenly confused and dizzy.
		If you see these things now you know what to do."
