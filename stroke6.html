  What happens next?

  The paramedics found your Grandma and successfully got her into the ambulance. Now they are taking her to the hospital. Sarah, one of the paramedics, waits with you while your Mom comes to pick you up. While you're waiting Sarah says, <br />

  "You did a great job calling 911 and telling us what happened. Giving the operator your address and how to find Grandma was the right thing to do. You helped us get here fast. We think she had an emergency medical problem called a stroke." <br />
	 Do you know what that is?
