		<h2> Question 4: </h2>

	You told the operator as much as you can about where you live. <br />

Operator: "Okay honey, we're sending an ambulence to you, they should be there soon. Make sure you leave the door unlocked so they can get in. Is there anything else I should know?" <br />

You notice that your grandma's speech has slurred some more. What should you do? <br />
